## Description

This repository serves as a central hub for all the exercises, projects, and code challenges completed during the "Complete Python Developer" course by Zero to Mastery and Angela Yu "100 Days of Code" course. It showcases my journey of mastering Python programming from scratch and provides a reference for anyone interested in learning Python.

## Projects

The repository includes various projects completed as part of the courses, demonstrating practical applications of Python programming concepts. Some of the projects include:

1. Project 1: [Band Name Generator](/Projects/Band%20name%20Generator.py) - Automatically Generates A Band Name based on Users Input.
2. Project 2: [Project Name](/projects/project2) - A brief description of the project.
3. Project 3: [Project Name](/projects/project3) - A brief description of the project.
   <!-- Addding more projects as needed -->

Each project folder contains the source code, documentation, and any additional resources required to understand and run the project.

## Resources

In addition to the course materials, I have compiled a list of additional resources that may be helpful for further learning and exploring Python. These resources include recommended books, websites, and articles. You can find the list of resources [here](/resources).

## Progress

I will be updating the repository regularly with my progress in completing the courses. You can track my progress through the commit history and the [Projects](#projects) section, where I will be adding completed projects.
