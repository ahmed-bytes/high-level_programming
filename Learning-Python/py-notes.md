# PYTHON SUMMARY NOTES
----------

## INTRO TO PYTHON
----------
*Python is good for automation, simple to use. It offers more structure and support for large programs. Compared to C/C++, Python programming doesn't necessary involves creating complex programs with more lines of code. It handles error checking than C*

***Python is extensible:*** *if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.*


## USING THE PYTHON INTERPRETER
----------
***The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.12***
*There are various ways to start interracting with the Python Interpreter in various OS. For Unix*
